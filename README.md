## A Repository for my Exapunks levels

### '__extra' - General purpose files for Exapunks level creation

* `__extra/exapunks.ts` contains the prototypes and documentation in accordance
  to [Axiom's VirtualNetwork+ Scripting Reference](https://www.zachtronics.com/virtualnetwork/).
* `__extra/implicitUsages.js` contains references to the mandatory five Configuration Script functions (stops IDEs from marking them as unused).
* `__extra/__test.ts` contains code I like to use when testing my levels inside of the IDE.
